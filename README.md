A minuature Unity game I built back at uni. 
The code is an absolute mess, and quite francly i was suprised it functions at all. 

However, you might find the assets interesting. All of them are either produced by me, or, in case of planet textures, already in the public domain. 

See video of the game: https://youtu.be/90cX6ao-jp4
It is also not on the Windows app store, requires Windows 8 or higher.
